How To Replicate:

1. Navigate to 'forgot password' on the 'sign in' page.
2. Inspect something on the page.
3. Locate the 'hidden' element.
4. Remove the email, then click the submit button.

Fixes:

Private information should be implemented on the backend. A HTML 'hidden' tag can still be viewed and changed.
